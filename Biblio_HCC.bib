Changes in the time trends of HCC and most variations in its age-, sex-, and race-specific rates among different regions are likely to be related to differences in hepatitis viruses that are most prevalent in a population, the timing of their spread, and the ages of the individuals the viruses infect. Environmental, host genetic, and viral factors can affect the risk of HCC in individuals with HBV or HCV infection. This review summarizes the risk factors for HCC among HBV- or HCV-infected individuals, based on findings from epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses, as well as determinants of patient outcome and the HCC disease burden, globally and in the United States.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Abstract Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3{\%} per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5{\%} per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0{\%} between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80{\%} of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3{\%}, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60{\%} of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma increased with serum HBV DNA level at study entry in a dose-response relationship ranging from 108 per 100 000 person-years for an HBV DNA level of less than 300 copies/mL to 1152 per 100 000 person-years for an HBV DNA level of 1 million copies/mL or greater. The corresponding cumulative incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma were 1.3{\%} and 14.9{\%}, respectively. The biological gradient of hepatocellular carcinoma by serum HBV DNA levels remained significant (P{\textless}.001) after adjustment for sex, age, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, serostatus for the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), serum alanine aminotransferase level, and liver cirrhosis at study entry. The dose-response relationship was most prominent for participants who were seronegative for HBeAg with normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels and no liver cirrhosis at study entry. Participants with persistent elevation of serum HBV DNA level during follow-up had the highest hepatocellular carcinoma risk.ConclusionElevated serum HBV DNA level (≥10 000 copies/mL) is a strong risk predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma independent of HBeAg, serum alanine aminotransferase level, and liver cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Background: Although chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been established as a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the roles of viral load and HBV genotype remain unclear. Methods: From 1988 through 1992, baseline blood samples were collected from 4841 Taiwanese men who were HBV carriers but had not been diagnosed with HCC. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction assays of plasma DNA samples to quantify HBV DNA levels (a measure of viral load) and determine HBV genotypes for 154 case patients who were diagnosed with HCC during 14 years of follow-up and 316 control subjects. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios (ORs) of HCC for HBV-related factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The risk of HCC increased with increasing HBV viral load (adjusted OR for the highest versus the lowest quintile of HBV DNA copies/mL = 7.26, 95$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} confidence interval [CI] = 3.54 to 14.89; Ptrend $\backslash$$\backslash${\textless}.001). Genotype C HBV was associated with an increased risk of HCC compared with other HBV genotypes (adjusted OR = 5.11, 95$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} CI = 3.20 to 8.18). Both viral load and genotype were positively associated with HCC within 10-year age categories among subjects aged 30 years old to older than 60 years. Genotype C HBV was associated with increased viral load, and associations of HBV genotype and viral load with HCC risk were additive. The adjusted OR of HCC for those carrying genotype C HBV and with viral load in the highest quintile was 26.49 (95$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} CI = 10.41 to 67.42) compared with HBV carriers with other HBV genotypes and viral load in the lowest two quintiles. Conclusions: Measurements of HBV viral load and genotype may help to define which male HBV carriers aged 30 years or older are at high risk for HCC. },

The summary random effects estimates were significant at P=0.05 in 20 meta-analyses (74{\%}); and all reported increased risks of developing cancer for participants with versus without diabetes. Of the 27 meta-analyses, eventually only seven (26{\%}) compiled evidence on more than 1000 cases, had significant summary associations at P{\textless}=0.001 for both random and fixed effects calculations, and had neither evidence of small study effects nor evidence for excess significance. Of those, only six (22{\%}) did not have substantial heterogeneity (I2{\textgreater}75{\%}), pertaining to associations between type 2 diabetes and risk of developing breast, cholangiocarcinoma (both intrahepatic and extrahepatic), colorectal, endometrial, and gallbladder cancer.

Smoking contributed to almost half of all hepatocellular carcinomas (47.6{\%}), whereas 13.2{\%} and 20.9{\%} were attributable to chronic HBV and HCV infection, respectively. Obesity and heavy alcohol intake contributed 16.1{\%} and 10.2{\%}, respectively. Almost two-thirds (65.7{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 50.6{\%} to 79.3{\%}) of hepatocellular carcinomas can be accounted for by exposure to at least one of these documented risk factors.Smoking contributed to more hepatocellular carcinomas in this Europe-wide cohort than chronic HBV and HCV infections. Heavy alcohol consumption and obesity also contributed to sizeable fractions of this disease burden. These contributions may be underestimates because EPIC volunteers are likely to be more health conscious than the general population.},

abstract = {Abstract Cirrhosis is a leading cause of death among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We sought to determine risk factors for and time trends in the prevalence of cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients diagnosed with HIV who received care in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system nationally between 1996 and 2009 (n = 24,040 in 2009). Among patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), there was a dramatic increase in the prevalence of cirrhosis (3.5{\%}-13.2{\%}), decompensated cirrhosis (1.9{\%}-5.8{\%}), and HCC (0.07{\%}-1.6{\%}). Little increase was observed among patients without HCV coinfection in the prevalence of cirrhosis (1.7{\%}-2.2{\%}), decompensated cirrhosis (1.1{\%}-1.2{\%}), and HCC (0.03{\%}-0.13{\%}). In 2009, HCV infection was present in the majority of patients with HIV who had cirrhosis (66{\%}), decompensated cirrhosis (62{\%}), and HCC (80{\%}). Independent risk factors for cirrhosis included HCV infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.82; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 5.0-6.7), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (AOR, 2.40; 95{\%} CI, 2.0-2.9), age (AOR, 1.03; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.04), Hispanic ethnicity (AOR, 1.76; 95{\%} CI, 1.4-2.2), diabetes (AOR, 1.79; 95{\%} CI, 1.6-2.1), and alcohol abuse (AOR, 1.78; 95{\%} CI, 1.5-2.1), whereas black race (AOR, 0.56; 95{\%} CI, 0.48-0.64) and successful eradication of HCV (AOR, 0.61; 95{\%} CI, 0.4-0.9) were protective. Independent risk factors for HCC included HCV infection (AOR, 10.0; 95{\%} CI, 6.1-16.4), HBV infection (AOR, 2.82; 95{\%} CI, 1.7-4.7), age (AOR, 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.08), and low CD4+ cell count (AOR, 2.36; 95{\%} CI, 1.3-4.2). Among 5999 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, 994 (18{\%}) had ever received HCV antiviral treatment, of whom 165 (17{\%}) achieved sustained virologic response. Conclusion: The prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC has increased dramatically among HIV-infected patients driven primarily by the HCV epidemic. Potentially modifiable risk factors include HCV infection, HBV infection, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and low CD4+ cell count. (HEPATOLOGY 2013)},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths globally. The most common causes for liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use. OBJECTIVE: To report results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study on primary liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from 1990 to 2015, and present global, regional, and national estimates on the burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and an "other" group that encompasses residual causes. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mortality was estimated using vital registration and cancer registry data in an ensemble modeling approach. Single-cause mortality estimates were adjusted for all-cause mortality. Incidence was derived from mortality estimates and the mortality-to-incidence ratio. Through a systematic literature review, data on the proportions of liver cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes were identified. Years of life lost were calculated by multiplying each death by a standard life expectancy. Prevalence was estimated using mortality-to-incidence ratio as surrogate for survival. Total prevalence was divided into 4 sequelae that were multiplied by disability weights to derive years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were the sum of years of life lost and YLDs. MAIN OUTCOMESAND MEASURES: Liver cancer mortality, incidence, YLDs, years of life lost, DALYs by etiology, age, sex, country, and year. RESULTS: There were 854 000 incident cases of liver cancer and 810 000 deaths globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs. Cases of incident liver cancer increased by 75{\%} between 1990 and 2015, of which 47{\%} can be explained by changing population age structures, 35{\%} by population growth, and -8{\%} to changing age-specific incidence rates. The male-to-female ratio for age-standardized liver cancer mortality was 2.8. Globally, HBV accounted for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33{\%}), alcohol for 245 000 (30{\%}), HCV for 167 000 (21{\%}), and other causes for 133 000 (16{\%}) deaths, with substantial variation between countries in the underlying etiologies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths in many countries. Causes of liver cancer differ widely among populations. Our results show that most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the identification and elimination of risk factors for liver cancer will be required to achieve a sustained reduction in liver cancer burden. The GBD study can be used to guide these prevention efforts.},
